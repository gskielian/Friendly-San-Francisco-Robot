Social-Experiment-Courier-Robot
===============================


## Description

Robots are always helping people. It's about time we give them some help back! As a San Francisco social experiment I'd like to create a friendly courier robot that will take packages from one destination to another. The robot would have electronics to know where it is and where it wants to go but would not have the ability to get there under it's own power.

Fortunately, it would be equipped with a friendly and perhaps witty repertoire of language to persuade pedestrians going the right way to help push the robot. The robot will rely on the generosity of strangers to help it get to where it wants to go. The robot would video stream and document it's interactions with people. 

I need help with this project. I'm looking for skilled hackers to help me with this fun experiment. I'll buy the parts and beer. I'm hoping Greg will will help me with this. If people think this would be a good Hackathon, let me know.
